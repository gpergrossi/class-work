# linked-lists example

This is the first part of the linked lists lab.  It only has
the record definition and one function, along with the tests.
The purpose of this is to help the students practice running
tests.

# Use

+ run `lein spec` and see all the error messages.
+ edit `src/linked_lists/core.clj` and write an `insert-at-front` function.
+ run `lein spec` again and see if you did it right.
