# first-one

A Clojure program designed to get students to load and write a
simple test.

## Usage

Use `lein spec` to run the specs.

You will find some error messages because the `abs` function is broken.  Fix
it.  Once that's done, try writing cases for the `bar` function; it should
add its two arguments together, but there is a bug.  Write tests to reveal
the bug, then fix the bug and use the tests to verify that you fixed it.

## Turning In

To hand in this in, use `git add` to stage the files you changed,
`git commit` to make the commit, and `git push` to send the files
to the server.
