I have completed all of the undefined functions except for exec CallStmt because I don't think
call fn(1,2,etc.); is valid syntax. What exactly should it do? Print the result? Functions can
only have an expression as a body, not a statement, so there can't be any side-effects.

Tests:

>a := 100;
>print a;
100

>mul := fn[a,b] a*b end;
>print call mul(a,20);
2000

>print if a-a==a*(1-1) then 11 else 0 fi;
111

>load "script";
>print a;
1
>print z;
26

>fact := fn[n] if n < 2 then 1 else n*(call self(n-1)) fi end;
>print call fact(4);
24

>print (true and false);
False
>print (true or false);
True
